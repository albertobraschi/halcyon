h2. Introduction to Halcyon

Halcyon is a simple framework to ease development of service-oriented applications, such as public or private APIs or custom services for applications.


h3. Conception

Halcyon started off as a centralized authentication system for numerous applications on varied platforms, at the time called Aurora. The decision was made to split Aurora into a framework and an application, Halcyon becoming the framework.


h3. The Framework

As a framework, Halcyon breaks your application code up into controllers with absolutely no views and no predefined system for models or database connectivity. Routes are used to define what paths are handled by what actions in which controllers.

Halcyon distinguishes itself by the distinct combination of technologies it employs to simplify its task. To clarify, Halcyon specifically chooses to reinvent as little as possible and yet provide a great deal of functionality. We do this by using standard HTTP protocols, transferring complex data across platforms with JSON, designing Halcyon apps on top of "Rack":http://rack.rubyforge.org/, and even reusing portions of "Merb":http://merbivore.com/ to prevent duplication. Here's a quick look at each of these.


h4. JSON

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a simple format to transport complex data structures across the HTTP medium and across to many platforms. It's a simple format like XML, easy to read and write (unlike XML), and serializable. "CouchDB":http://couchdb.com/ chose JSON over XML for similar reasons, and has been very happy with the decision.



h4. HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a widely support protocol, supported on pretty much every platform, and provides a familiar way to modify resources with Representational State Transfer.


h4. Rack

Rack provides a uniform model for handling HTTP request and response cycles, allowing for server-independent development and for powerful layering of applications and specialized functionality through middleware.

Jim Weirich's talk at MountainWest 2008 focuses on the power of simplicity. Specifically, Jim mentions three poignant parts to a powerful system, having:

# Small Core
# Simple Rules
# Powerful Abstractions

Rack's design elegantly shows off the power of its simplicity.


h4. Merb

Having Merb as a dependency of Halcyon seems a bit ironic, but its active community, quality modular code, and thorough documentation provides an excellent souce of functionality without all of the repetitive development. Halcyon specifically takes advantage of the Merb Router and the Core Extensions.
