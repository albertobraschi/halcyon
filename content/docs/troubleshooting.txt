h2. Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting Halcyon applications can be tricky, but Halcyon should be solid
enough that most exceptions raised should be caught and the error logged along
where your logger has been specified (by default to standard out) and should
keep running. This means that the log should be your first place to check for
issues in the code.


h3. The Console

Halcyon applications can be run through a server or can be run through the
console interactively. To run your app this way (to hand construct requests
and prod and poke your app to find the exact point of failure), simply run:

<pre><code>
$ halcyon -i
</code></pre>

This will start your application in <em>interactive</em> mode, similar to the
@merb -i@ console.


h3. @500 Server Internal Error@ and Uncaught Exceptions

Since most errors won't crash the server and will be logged, you will rarely
have to look hard to find what happened, though finding out why may be a
different matter.

If an uncaught exception (that doesn't inherit from
@Halcyon::Exceptions::Base@) does occur, you should expect a simple response of
@500 Internal Server Error@. If this does occur, simply look through the strack
trace in the log and determine where in your code the problem exists.


h3. Standard Debugging Tools

In the course of figuring out issues you may be having, don't forget about some
of the excellent debugging tools available to the Ruby community such as
@ruby-debug@ and various other debuggers.


h3. Bugs

Of course, Halcyon isn't bug free so if you experience a problem with the
framework itself, please visit our "issue tracker":http://halcyon.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7222-halcyon/overview
and submit a bug report! Be sure to tag it with the @bug@ tag.


h2. Known Issues

As time progresses, we will try to document known gotchas and issues you may
face while learning the ins and outs of Halcyon application development.

* Windows users may experience a "FloatingDomainError issue":http://halcyon.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7222/tickets/46-floatdomainerror. This is resolved in 0.5.1!
