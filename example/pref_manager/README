= Preference Manager

== Introduction

This is a oversimplified, quickly (and poorly) designed preference manager.

Really it just shows you have to get started passing valuable data back and
forth between the client and the server.

== Apologies

I'm certainly sorry that it isn't top tier application design, you'll forgive
me I hope for not spending a great deal of time on this example. I do promise
to address it in the future and make it sharp, but for now my apologies will
have to suffice.

== TODO

* Clean up the logic and model so that it makes more sense and has more real-
  world sanity.
* Make the user feel like they're talking to an ActiveRecord object, for
  instance, allowing them to perform the various CRUD functionality.
