= Aurora

Aurora is an Authentication system designed to centralize the actual
authentication process for numerous independent applications, not necessarily
running on the same platform (such as a legacy PHP application).

Aurora is being developed in parallel to Halcyon, and was in fact the reason
that Halcyon exists: Aurora at first was both the framework and application but
the application was separated from the framework to make reuse of the framework
design.

Aurora is stored at http://github.com/mtodd/aurora and is open source.
